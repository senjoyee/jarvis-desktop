From forest boughs our ancestors swung,
In social bands, by sun and shadow sung.
Stone met hand; a sharper edge was born,
And fire turned night to hearth, to hope, to dawn.

Feet found the ground, then carried us afar,
Across new rivers, under the same star.
Words learned to braid our thoughts in living thread,
And questions grew where fear and hunger fed.

From ape to human—slow, unbroken stream:
A million steps toward mind, and myth, and dream.
Yet in our eyes the ancient wild remains—
The old world’s breath within our modern veins.
