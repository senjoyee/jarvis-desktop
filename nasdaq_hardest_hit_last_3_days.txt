NASDAQ hardest-hit stocks over the last 2–3 trading days (best-effort; incomplete)
As of: 2026-02-05

Request:
- “Top 20 stocks listed on NASDAQ that got hit the hardest in the last 2–3 days”

Result (limitation):
- A complete, verifiable “top 20” ranked list over the last 2–3 sessions could not be produced from the available Perplexity search results.
- The sources returned were primarily news summaries and did not include a downloadable NASDAQ screener output or a comprehensive list of all NASDAQ tickers with 2–3 day cumulative % changes.

Closest available data found (largest *single-day* declines mentioned in reputable articles within the last ~3 sessions):

Notes:
- The above list is NOT a full “top 20 biggest losers” list; it is only what was explicitly enumerated with % moves in the available search results.
- The request requires either:
  (a) a NASDAQ stock screener snapshot sorted by performance over a configurable period, or
  (b) historical daily closes for all NASDAQ-listed tickers to compute cumulative % change over the last 2–3 sessions.

How to generate the true “top 20” (recommended approach):
1) Use the NASDAQ Stock Screener and export results:
   https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener
   - Filter: Exchange = NASDAQ
   - Export the table (CSV) for the date of interest.
2) For each ticker, pull daily close for the last 3 sessions (e.g., via Nasdaq historical data, Yahoo Finance, or a market-data API).
3) Compute cumulative 3-session change:
   %Change = (Close_today / Close_3_sessions_ago - 1) * 100
4) Sort ascending (most negative) and take the top 20.

If you want, tell me whether you want:
- “last 2 sessions” or “last 3 sessions” exactly, and
- whether OTC/ADRs are allowed,
then I can provide a script (Python) to produce the exact top-20 list using a data provider you choose (e.g., Nasdaq export + yfinance, Alpha Vantage, Polygon, IEX Cloud).
